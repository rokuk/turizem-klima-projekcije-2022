- Snow analysis is in [Snow.md](/R/Snow.md)
- Analysis for a few chosen ARSO stations is in [WeatherStations.md](/R/WeatherStations.md)
- Calculation of CIT and HCI from ARSO data is in [ARSO-CIT-HCI.md](/R/ARSO-CIT-HCI.md)

Figures are in the [output](https://github.com/rokuk/turizem-klima-projekcije-2022/tree/main/output) folder.

Data is in the [data](https://github.com/rokuk/turizem-klima-projekcije-2022/tree/main/data) folder. Data from the Climate Data Store is not in the repository due to its excessive size. It can be downloaded from [DOI: 10.24381/cds.126d9ce7](https://doi.org/10.24381/cds.126d9ce7) and [CDS](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/sis-tourism-snow-indicators?tab=overview). All other data was provided by [ARSO](https://www.arso.gov.si) (Slovenian Environmental Agency).
